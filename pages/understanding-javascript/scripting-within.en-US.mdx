# Scripting within HTML

JavaScript is commonly used as a scripting language within HTML to make web pages dynamic and interactive. In this article, we'll explore how to include JavaScript code in HTML documents, handle events, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Including JavaScript in HTML

JavaScript code can be included directly within HTML documents using the `<script>` tag. You can place the `<script>` tag in the `<head>` or`<body>`section of your HTML document.

### Inline Script

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Scripting with JavaScript</title>
    <script>
      // Your JavaScript code goes here
      alert("Hello, World!");
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content of the HTML body -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### External Script

You can also include JavaScript code from external files using the src attribute.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Scripting with JavaScript</title>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content of the HTML body -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Handling Events

JavaScript allows you to respond to user actions, such as clicks or key presses, through event handling. Here's an example of handling a button click:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Event Handling with JavaScript</title>
    <script>
      function handleClick() {
        alert("Button Clicked!");
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="handleClick()">Click me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Manipulating the DOM

The DOM represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects. JavaScript can be used to manipulate this tree, changing the content, structure, or style of the document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>DOM Manipulation with JavaScript</title>
    <script>
      function changeText() {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Text Changed!";
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="demo">Original Text</p>
    <button onclick="changeText()">Change Text</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, clicking the button triggers the changeText function, which uses `getElementById` to select the HTML element with the ID `'demo'` and changes its content.

Scripting within HTML using JavaScript opens the door to creating dynamic and interactive web pages. As you explore further, you'll discover more ways to enhance user experiences and add functionality to your websites. Happy coding!
