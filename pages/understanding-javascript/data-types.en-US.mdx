# Data Types 

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means variables can hold values of different types. Each data type in JavaScript serves a specific purpose, and understanding them is crucial for effective programming. In this article, we'll explore the basic data types in JavaScript and how to use them.

## Primitive Data Types

JavaScript has six primitive data types:

### String

- Represents textual data.
- Enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

  ```javascript
  let message = "Hello, World!";
  ```

### Number

Represents numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers.

```js
let age = 25;
let pi = 3.14;
```

### Boolean

Represents a logical value, either true or false.

```js
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;
```

### Undefined

Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

```js
let undefinedVariable;
```

### Null

Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

```js
let nullValue = null;
```

### Symbol

Introduced in ECMAScript 6, symbols are unique and immutable data types, often used as identifiers for object properties.

```js
const symbolKey = Symbol("uniqueKey");
```

## Complex Data Types

JavaScript also has complex data types:

### Object

Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings or symbols, and values can be any data type.

```js
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
};
```

### Array

Represents an ordered list of values.

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
```

Understanding these data types is fundamental to JavaScript programming. As you progress, you'll frequently work with these types while building more complex applications. In the next articles, we'll explore operators, type conversion, and other advanced topics. Happy coding!
