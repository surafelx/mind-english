# Operators

Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands. These operations can include arithmetic calculations, logical comparisons, and more. In this article, we'll delve into the various types of operators in JavaScript and how they can be used.

<Steps>

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations on numeric values.

```js
let a = 5;
let b = 3;

let sum = a + b; // Addition
let difference = a - b; // Subtraction
let product = a * b; // Multiplication
let quotient = a / b; // Division
let remainder = a % b; // Modulus (remainder)
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare values and return a Boolean result.

```js
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let isEqual = x === y; // Strict equality
let isNotEqual = x !== y; // Strict inequality
let greaterThan = x > y; // Greater than
let lessThan = x < y; // Less than
let greaterOrEqual = x >= y; // Greater than or equal to
let lessOrEqual = x <= y; // Less than or equal to
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators perform logical operations and return a Boolean result.

```js
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;

let andOperator = isTrue && isFalse; // Logical AND
let orOperator = isTrue || isFalse; // Logical OR
let notOperator = !isTrue; // Logical NOT
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to variables.

```js
let num = 10;

num += 5; // Equivalent to num = num + 5;
num -= 3; // Equivalent to num = num - 3;
num *= 2; // Equivalent to num = num * 2;
num /= 4; // Equivalent to num = num / 4;
```

### Unary Operators

Unary operators operate on a single operand.

```js
let count = 5;

count++; // Increment by 1 (post-increment)
++count; // Increment by 1 (pre-increment)
count--; // Decrement by 1 (post-decrement)
--count; // Decrement by 1 (pre-decrement)
```

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a concise way to write an if-else statement.

```js
let age = 20;

let isAdult = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
```

</Steps>

Understanding these operators is essential for manipulating data and controlling the flow of your JavaScript code. As you practice and build more complex applications, mastering these operators will enhance your programming skills. In future articles, we'll explore more advanced JavaScript concepts. Happy coding!
