# Birth of HTML

HTML traces its roots back to the early 1990s when a British scientist named Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. In 1991, he proposed the concept of a hypertext system to facilitate information-sharing among researchers. The first version of HTML, imaginatively titled HTML 1.0, was born in 1993, laying the foundation for the interconnected web we know today.
