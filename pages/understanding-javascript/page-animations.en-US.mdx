# Page Animations

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

Adding page animations to your website can enhance user experience and make the browsing journey more engaging. JavaScript, in combination with CSS, is often used to implement various types of page animations. Below, I'll guide you through the process of adding a simple page transition effect using JavaScript.

Let's consider a scenario where you want to apply a fade-out transition when navigating between pages.

<Steps>

### Update Your HTML Structure

Ensure that each of your website pages has a consistent structure and includes a container for the page content. For example:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- ... (head content) ... -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="page-container">
      <!-- Page content goes here -->
    </div>
    <script src="transition.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Create a CSS Transition

Update your existing CSS file (`styles.css`) to include a fade-out transition. For example:

```css
/* styles.css */
.page-container {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.page-hidden {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

This CSS code sets up a transition on the opacity property, making it smoothly change over 0.5 seconds with an ease-in-out timing function. The page-hidden class will be used to temporarily hide the page during the transition.

### Implement JavaScript Transition

Create a new JavaScript file (`transition.js`) and add the following code:

```js
// transition.js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  // Add a click event listener to all anchor tags
  const links = document.querySelectorAll("a");
  links.forEach(function (link) {
    link.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
      // Prevent the default navigation behavior
      event.preventDefault();

      // Get the href attribute of the clicked link
      const targetPage = link.getAttribute("href");

      // Add the page-hidden class to initiate the fade-out transition
      document.querySelector(".page-container").classList.add("page-hidden");

      // After a delay (adjust as needed), navigate to the new page
      setTimeout(function () {
        window.location.href = targetPage;
      }, 500); // Wait for the transition duration
    });
  });
});
```

This JavaScript code listens for click events on all anchor tags (`<a>` elements) and triggers a fade-out transition by adding the page-hidden class to the page container. After a short delay (in this case, 500 milliseconds to match the transition duration), it redirects to the target page.

</Steps>

## Important Note
Ensure that your website pages have the same structure, including the .page-container element.
Adjust the timing and transition properties in the CSS and JavaScript code to suit your design preferences.
This is a basic example, and you can customize it further based on your specific needs and design preferences.
