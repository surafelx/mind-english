# Props

In React, props (short for properties) provide a way to pass data from a parent component to its child components. This mechanism facilitates the communication and sharing of information between different parts of a React application. Let's explore the fundamentals of using props in React components.

### Passing Props

Props are passed from a parent component to a child component as attributes. They allow you to send data along with the component when it's being used.

- Parent Component

```jsx
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from "react";
import ChildComponent from "./ChildComponent";

function ParentComponent() {
  const message = "Hello from Parent!";

  return <ChildComponent greeting={message} />;
}
```

- Child Component

```jsx
// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from "react";

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>{props.greeting}</p>;
}
```

In this example, the `ParentComponent` passes a prop greeting to the `ChildComponent`, which then displays the message.

### Default Props

You can set default values for props in a component using the defaultProps property. This ensures that the component works correctly even if a prop is not explicitly provided.

```jsx
// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from "react";

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>{props.greeting}</p>;
}

ChildComponent.defaultProps = {
  greeting: "Default Greeting",
};
```

If the greeting prop is not supplied, the default value will be used.

### Destructuring Props

To make the code cleaner, you can destructure props directly in the function parameter.

```jsx
// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from "react";

function ChildComponent({ greeting }) {
  return <p>{greeting}</p>;
}
```

This approach makes it clearer which props the component is using.

### Dynamic Props

Props are not limited to static values; you can pass dynamic data, functions, or even entire components.

- Parent Component
  ˝

```jsx
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from "react";
import ChildComponent from "./ChildComponent";

function ParentComponent() {
  const handleClick = () => alert("Button clicked");

  return <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />;
}
```

- Child Component

```jsx
// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

function ChildComponent(props) {
return <button onClick={props.onClick}>Click me</button>;
}˝
```

Here, the `ParentComponent` passes a function as a prop to the `ChildComponent`, which triggers an alert when the button is clicked.

### Immutable Props

In React, props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the child components. This ensures a unidirectional flow of data and helps maintain a predictable state.

</Steps>

Understanding how to effectively use props is crucial for building modular and reusable React components. Whether passing simple data or functions, props serve as a powerful mechanism for communication between components in a React application.
