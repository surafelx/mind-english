# Creating a React App with create-react-app

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

Creating a new React application is a straightforward process, thanks to the create-react-app tool. This tool sets up a new React project with a sensible default configuration, allowing you to focus on building your application. Follow the steps below to create your first React app:

<Steps>

### Install `create-react-app`

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install create-react-app globally:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

This installs create-react-app as a global package on your system.

### Create a New React App

Once the installation is complete, you can use create-react-app to generate a new React project. Choose a name for your project (replace "my-react-app" with your desired project name) and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

This command creates a new directory named "my-react-app" (or your chosen project name) and sets up the basic structure and configuration for a React app.

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Move into the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

### Run the Development Server

Start the development server to see your new React app in action:

```bash
npm start
```

This command initiates the development server, and you can view your React app by opening http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

</Steps>

That's it! You've successfully created a new React app using create-react-app. You can now begin building your application by editing files within the "src" directory. The development server will automatically update as you make changes, providing a smooth development experience.
