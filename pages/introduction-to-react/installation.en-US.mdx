Before diving into React development, it's essential to set up Node.js and npm on your machine. These tools will help manage dependencies and run scripts for your React applications. Follow this guide to install Node.js and npm:

## Install Node.js and npm

<Steps>

### Download Node.js

Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/.

On the homepage, you'll find the LTS (Long-Term Support) version recommended for most users. Click on the "LTS" tab to download the installer for your operating system.

### Run the Installer

Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
Accept the license agreement and choose the default settings unless you have specific preferences.

### Check Installation

After installation, open your terminal or command prompt.

Verify that Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
```

If installed successfully, these commands will display the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Node.js and npm on your machine. Now you're ready to start building React applications.

### Updating npm (Optional)

npm is the package manager for Node.js, and it receives updates independently. You can update npm to the latest version using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g npm
```

This command installs the latest version of npm globally on your system.

</Steps>
With Node.js and npm installed, you're equipped to set up React projects, install dependencies, and run scripts for smooth development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, having these tools in place is fundamental to the React development workflow.
