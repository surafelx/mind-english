# Lifecycle Methods

React components go through a lifecycle that encompasses different phases, providing developers with various opportunities to perform actions and handle events. Here, we'll explore the key lifecycle methods and their significance in building React applications.

Mounting Lifecycle
1. constructor() Method:
Initializes the component.
Invoked before it is mounted.
Used for setting initial state and binding methods.
2. static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, nextState) Method:
Invoked right before rendering when new props or state are received.
Returns an object to update state or null if no state update is needed.
3. render() Method:
Responsible for rendering the component.
Pure function that should not modify state or interact with the DOM directly.
4. componentDidMount() Method:
Invoked after the component is inserted into the DOM.
Ideal for performing initial setup, fetching data, or interacting with the DOM.
Updating Lifecycle
5. shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) Method:
Invoked before rendering when new props or state are received.
Determines if the component should re-render.
Helps optimize performance by preventing unnecessary renders.
6. render() Method:
Same as in the Mounting phase.
7. componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) Method:
Invoked after the component has been updated.
Ideal for performing side effects based on changes in props or state.
Unmounting Lifecycle
8. componentWillUnmount() Method:
Invoked just before the component is unmounted and destroyed.
Used for cleanup tasks, such as clearing timers or canceling network requests.
Error Handling Lifecycle
9. static getDerivedStateFromError(error) Method:
Invoked when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor.
Returns an object to update state or null if no state update is needed.
10. componentDidCatch(error, info) Method:
Invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component.
Used to log error information or perform fallback UI rendering.
Understanding these lifecycle methods is crucial for effective React development. They provide control over different stages of a component's existence, allowing developers to manage state, perform side effects, and handle errors appropriately.
