# Lists

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the backbone of web development, allowing developers to structure content and create interactive user interfaces. In this exploration, we'll dive into two essential elements of HTML: Lists and Forms.

## The Art of Lists in HTML

Lists play a crucial role in organizing and presenting information on web pages. HTML provides three main types of lists: unordered lists (`<ul>`), ordered lists (`<ol>`), and definition lists (`<dl>`).

## Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)

An unordered list is a collection of items where the order doesn't matter. Each item is marked with a bullet point. Let's consider an example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

This HTML code creates an unordered list with three items:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)

In contrast, an ordered list represents a sequence of items with a specific order. Each item is numbered. Here's an example:

This HTML code generates an ordered list with numbered items:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Definition Lists (`<dl>`)

A definition list consists of a set of terms (`<dt>`) and their corresponding definitions (`<dd>`). It's commonly used for glossaries or dictionaries:

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>Definition 1</dd>

  <dt>Term 2</dt>
  <dd>Definition 2</dd>
</dl>
```


This HTML code produces a definition list:

- **Term 1**: Definition 1
- **Term 2**: Definition 2
