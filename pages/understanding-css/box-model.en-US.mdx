import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

## Overview

The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that defines the layout of HTML elements as rectangular boxes. Each box comprises content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the Box Model is crucial for creating well-structured and visually appealing web layouts.

<Steps>

### Content

- Represents the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other media.
- Controlled by the width and height properties.

### Padding

- The space between the content and the border.
- Padding adds internal space within the box.
- Controlled by properties like `padding-top`, `padding-righ`t, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left`.

### Border

- A border surrounding the padding (if any) and content.
- Adds a visible boundary to the element.
- Properties include `border-width`, `border-style`, and` border-color`.

### Margin

- The space outside the border.
- Creates space between the element and its neighboring elements.
- Controlled by properties like `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom` and `margin-left`.

#### Example

```css
/* Example of Box Model */
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid #333;
  margin: 10px;
}
```

In this example, the `.box` class defines a box with a `width` and `height` of `200px` and `150px`, respectively. It has `20px` of `padding`, a `2px` `solid` `border` with a `color` of #`333`, and a `margin` of `10px`.
