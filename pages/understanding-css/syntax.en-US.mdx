# Syntax

CSS employs a concise and straightforward syntax that revolves around selectors and declarations. Understanding this syntax is essential for effectively styling HTML documents. Let's break down the basic structure:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

- **Selector**: Identifies the HTML element or elements that you want to style. It can be an element name, class, ID, or a combination of these.

- **Declaration Block**: Enclosed in curly braces {}, it contains one or more declarations. Each declaration consists of a property and its corresponding value.

- **Property**: Describes the style aspect you want to modify, such as color or font-size.

- **Value**: Specifies the setting for the property, like blue or 16px.

#### Example

```css
/* This rule targets all paragraphs and sets the color to red */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* This rule targets all elements with class 'highlight' and sets the background color to yellow */
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

- The first rule selects all `<p>` (paragraph) elements and sets their text color to red.
- The second rule selects all elements with the class `highlight` and sets their background color to yellow.
