# Introduction

Flexbox is a CSS layout model designed for building dynamic and responsive layouts. It simplifies the arrangement of elements within a container, allowing for flexible distribution of space and alignment along both the main and cross axes. With its parent-child relationship, flex containers and items enable efficient design and adaptability to various screen sizes. On the other hand, CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that facilitates the creation of two-dimensional grid-based layouts. It excels in organizing content into rows and columns, providing precise control over the placement and sizing of elements. Together, Flexbox and Grid offer robust solutions for building modern and responsive web layouts, each catering to different layout requirements and scenarios.
