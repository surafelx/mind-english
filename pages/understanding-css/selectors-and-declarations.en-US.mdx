# Selectors and Declarations

## Selectors

Selectors pinpoint HTML elements to which you want to apply styles. There are various types of selectors:

### Element Selector

Targets specific HTML elements (e.g., `p` for paragraphs).

### Class Selector

Targets elements with a specific class (e.g., `.highlight` for elements with the class `highlight`).

### ID Selector

Targets a specific element with a unique ID (e.g., `#header` for an element with the ID `header`).

### Descendant Selector

Targets an element that is a descendant of another element (e.g., article `p` targets paragraphs inside articles).

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

#### Example

```css
/* This rule targets all paragraphs and sets the color to red */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* This rule targets all elements with class 'highlight' and sets the background color to yellow */
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

This modular approach allows developers to apply styles consistently across multiple elements.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <title>Selectors Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="main-title">Hello, CSS!</h1>
    <p class="highlight">This is a paragraph with a highlight class.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.main-title {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 28px;
}

.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

## Declarations

Declarations, contained within curly braces `{}`, define the style properties for the selected elements.

```css
/* Example */
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

In this example, the h1 selector targets all `<h1>` elements, and the declarations set their text color to blue and font size to 24 pixels.

Understanding the relationship between selectors and declarations is foundational to effective CSS styling. It provides developers with the means to precisely control the presentation of HTML elements on a webpage.
