import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

### Overview

Flexbox, short for Flexible Box, is a powerful layout model introduced in CSS that allows developers to design complex and responsive web layouts with ease. It provides a more efficient way to distribute space among items in a container and align them along a single axis or both. Flexbox is particularly useful for creating dynamic and flexible layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.

## Flexbox Properties


<Steps>

### Display Property

- To enable Flexbox, set the `display` property of the container to `flex`.
- This property transforms the container's children into flexible items.

### Flex Container Properties

#### `flex-direction`

Defines the direction of the main axis, which determines the flow of the flex container. It can be set to:

- `row`: Items are placed in a horizontal line (default).
- `column`: Items are placed in a vertical line.

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <style>
    .flex-container {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row; /* or column */
    }

    .flex-item {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      margin: 10px;
      background-color: lightblue;
    }
  </style>

<body>

  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
  </div>

</body>
</html>

```
#### `justify-content`

Aligns items along the main axis. This property determines how extra space is distributed. Common values include:

- `flex-start`: Items are packed toward the start of the flex container.
- `flex-end`: Items are packed toward the end of the flex container.
- `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
- `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
  center: Items are centered along the main axis.

  <style>
    .flex-container {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between; /* or flex-start, flex-end, space-around, center */
    }

    .flex-item {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: lightcoral;
    }

  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
  </div>

</body>
</html>


```
#### `align-items`

Aligns items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis). Common values include:

- `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the cross axis. -` flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: Items are centered along the cross axis.
- `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container along the cross axis.

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <style>
    .flex-container {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center; /* or flex-start, flex-end, stretch */
      height: 200px; /* Set a fixed height for demonstration */
    }

    .flex-item {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: lightgreen;
    }
  </style>
  <title>align-items Example</title>
</head>
<body>

  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
    <div class="flex-item"></div>
  </div>

</body>
</html>

```
```css
/* Example of Flexbox */
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

In this example, the `.flex-container` class creates a Flexbox container with items spaced evenly along the main axis (horizontal) and centered along the cross axis (vertical)

### Benefits of Flexbox

#### Dynamic Layouts

Flexbox simplifies the creation of dynamic and flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

#### Easy Alignment
Aligning items both horizontally and vertically becomes intuitive with justify-content and align-items.

#### Responsive Design
Ideal for building responsive designs, especially in situations where the number of items or their sizes are not fixed.

#### Efficient Space Distribution
The space-between and space-around values of justify-content make efficient use of available space.

#### Ordering Flex Items
Flex items can be reordered using the order property, allowing for flexibility in visual arrangement.

In conclusion, Flexbox is a valuable tool for creating responsive and adaptive layouts. Its simplicity and versatility make it an essential part of modern web development, empowering developers to build visually engaging interfaces with minimal effort.
