# Handling HTTP Request

Handling different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is a fundamental aspect of building robust web applications. In this article, we'll explore how to handle these requests using JavaScript, focusing on server-side implementations.

Handling HTTP Requests with Node.js and Express
For our examples, we'll use Node.js along with the Express framework, a popular choice for building web applications and APIs.

1. Setting Up the Project
First, let's set up a simple Node.js project with Express. Ensure you have Node.js installed, and create a new project folder. Run the following commands in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
mkdir http-requests-example
cd http-requests-example
npm init -y
npm install express
Create a file named app.js for your application code.

2. Creating an Express Server
In app.js, set up a basic Express server:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
Run your server with node app.js to ensure everything is working.

3. Handling GET Requests
Let's create a simple route to handle GET requests:

javascript
Copy code
app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'GET request received!' });
});
Now, if you navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/data in your browser, you should see the JSON response.

4. Handling POST Requests
To handle POST requests, you need to include the body-parser middleware. Install it by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install body-parser
Update your app.js:

javascript
Copy code
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.json()); // Parse JSON requests

app.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  const { newData } = req.body;
  // Process the new data
  res.json({ message: `POST request received with data: ${newData}` });
});
Send a POST request using a tool like Postman or through a form in your application.

5. Handling PUT and DELETE Requests
Similarly, you can handle PUT and DELETE requests:

javascript
Copy code
app.put('/api/data/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { updatedData } = req.body;
  // Update data with the specified ID
  res.json({ message: `PUT request received for ID ${id} with data: ${updatedData}` });
});

app.delete('/api/data/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  // Delete data with the specified ID
  res.json({ message: `DELETE request received for ID ${id}` });
});
These examples showcase the basic setup for handling different HTTP requests using Node.js and Express. Depending on your application's complexity, you might integrate databases, authentication, and additional middleware to enhance functionality.
