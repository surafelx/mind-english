# XHTML and HTML5

In the early 2000s, XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) aimed to create a stricter, more XML-like version of HTML. However, HTML5 emerged as the dominant standard, officially released in 2014. HTML5 brought new semantic elements, enhanced multimedia support, and improved APIs, making it the modern standard for web development.
