# Use Cases
React Context API and global state management play crucial roles in maintaining state across components in a React application. Let's explore some common use cases for both the React Context API and global state management.

1. Theming:
Scenario:
You want to implement a theming feature where the user can switch between light and dark themes.

React Context API:
Create a context for the theme and provide it at the top level of your component tree. Components deeper in the tree can consume this context to dynamically apply the selected theme.

Global State Management:
Store the selected theme in a global state. Any component interested in the theme can access and update it from the global state.

2. User Authentication:
Scenario:
You need to track the user's authentication status throughout the application.

React Context API:
Create a context for user authentication. Wrap your application with a context provider that manages the user's authentication state. Components can consume this context to conditionally render content based on the user's authentication status.

Global State Management:
Maintain the user's authentication status in global state. Any component requiring authentication information can access it directly from the global state.

3. Language Localization:
Scenario:
You want to support multiple languages in your application.

React Context API:
Create a context for language localization and provide it at the top level. Components can use this context to access the current language and update it when needed.

Global State Management:
Store the selected language in global state. Components responsible for language selection and those requiring localized content can access and update the language from the global state.

4. Dark Mode:
Scenario:
Implement a dark mode feature that users can toggle on and off.

React Context API:
Create a context for dark mode and provide it at the top level. Components can consume this context to apply specific styling when dark mode is active.

Global State Management:
Store the dark mode status in global state. Any component interested in the dark mode setting can access and update it from the global state.

5. Shopping Cart:
Scenario:
Maintain a global shopping cart state that needs to be accessible from various components.

React Context API:
Create a context for the shopping cart and provide it at the top level. Components like product listings, individual product pages, and the shopping cart itself can consume this context.

Global State Management:
Manage the shopping cart state globally. Components across the application can interact with the global state to add, remove, or update items in the shopping cart.

Conclusion:
Whether you choose React Context API or global state management depends on your project's specific requirements and preferences. In simpler cases, the React Context API might suffice, while more complex applications may benefit from the centralized control offered by global state management libraries like Redux or Recoil. Consider the scope, complexity, and scalability of your application when making the decision.
