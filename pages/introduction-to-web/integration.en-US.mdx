# Integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


These three technologies work harmoniously to create a dynamic web experience.
HTML structures the content, CSS styles the appearance, and JavaScript adds
functionality. Consider a scenario where a button, when clicked, changes the
background color of a webpage. This involves all three technologies working
together:

```html filename="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Dynamic Web Experience</title>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
        background-color: #f0f0f0;
      }

      button {
        padding: 10px;
        font-size: 16px;
      }
    </style>
    <script>
      function changeColor() {
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'lightblue'
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to a Dynamic Web Experience</h1>
    <button onclick="changeColor()">Change Background Color</button>
  </body>
</html>
```


- `HTML` structures the page content.
- `CSS` styles the body and button elements.
- `JavaScript` adds interactivity to change the background color when the button
  is clicked.

Understanding how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript collaborate is key to crafting
engaging and user-friendly websites. As you progress through this course, you'll
delve deeper into each technology, gaining the skills to create dynamic and
visually appealing web experiences. Happy coding!
