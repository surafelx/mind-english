# Introducing HTML


HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the cornerstone of web development,
providing the structural foundation for every webpage. It uses a markup system
with tags to define the elements on a page, such as headings, paragraphs,
images, and links.

## Brief Explanation of HTML

HTML is like the framework of a building, defining the structure and layout of
content. Let's explore a basic HTML structure:

```html filename="index.html"
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage built with HTML.</p>
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image" />
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Defines the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage (displayed on the browser tab).
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the webpage.
- `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<a>`: Various HTML tags for headings, paragraphs,
  images, and links.
