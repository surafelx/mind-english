# Tools and Techniques


Welcome, aspiring web developers! In this article, we'll walk you through the essential setup for our Introduction to Web Development course. Understanding and configuring the right tools is crucial for a smooth journey into the world of web development. Let's explore the key tools and techniques you'll need, along with detailed explanations.

<Steps>

### Tool 1: Web Browser
Our first tool is a web browser, the gateway to displaying the web pages you'll create. A web browser is a software application designed to retrieve and present information on the World Wide Web. Popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. For this course, I recommend using Google Chrome for consistency, but feel free to choose the browser you're most comfortable with. If you don't have Chrome installed, you can find the download link in the description below.

### Tool 2: Text Editor
Next up is a text editor, a fundamental tool for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. A text editor is a software application that allows you to create and edit plain text files. For our course, I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code. Unlike basic text editors such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code is a powerful, free, and open-source editor specifically tailored for web development. It comes with features that make coding more efficient and enjoyable. Head to the link in the description to download Visual Studio Code and enhance your coding experience.

### Tool 3: Git and GitHub
The third tool in our toolkit is Git, a version control system, and GitHub, a platform for storing and collaborating on code. Let's delve into the concepts:

**What is Version Control?**
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, so you can recall specific versions later. It facilitates collaboration and allows you to revert files to a previous state.

**Git - The Version Control System:**
Git is a widely used distributed version control system. It allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your project seamlessly.

**GitHub - Collaboration Platform:**
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers a collaborative environment for developers to work together on projects, share code, and manage software development workflows.

Setting up Git and GitHub
Setting up Git and GitHub might seem a bit complex initially, but it's a crucial step for effective collaboration and code management. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Download Git:**

Visit the provided link to download Git. Install it on your machine.

2. **Create a GitHub Account:**

If you don't already have a GitHub account, visit the GitHub website and create one. It's a straightforward process.

3. **Link GitHub Account to Git:**

Depending on your operating system, use the terminal on Mac/Linux or Git Bash on Windows. These are command-line interfaces that allow you to interact with your computer using text commands. Enter the provided commands to link your GitHub account to Git.

4. **Setting up SSH Key (Optional but recommended):**

SSH (Secure Shell) keys provide a secure way to connect to your GitHub account. Check if you have existing SSH keys and generate new ones if needed. Follow the provided commands to add your SSH key to GitHub.

5. **Test Your Setup:**

Open your terminal or Git Bash and enter ssh -T git@github.com. This command tests whether your SSH key is successfully set up and authenticated on GitHub. You should receive a message confirming successful authentication.
Congratulations! You're now set up with Git and GitHub. If you encounter any issues, GitHub's official documentation on setting up your SSH key is linked in the description for further guidance.
