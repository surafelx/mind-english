# Manipulating Arrays

Array manipulation is a crucial skill in JavaScript, especially as you progress to an intermediate level. Let's explore advanced array manipulation techniques that can enhance your coding capabilities.

## Functional Array Methods

JavaScript provides powerful functional methods for arrays, such as map, filter, and reduce. These methods enable concise and expressive operations on arrays.

<Steps>

### Map

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num ** 2);
console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Filter


```js
const scores = [75, 80, 95, 60, 85];

const highScores = scores.filter((score) => score >= 80);
console.log(highScores); // Output: [80, 95, 85]
```

### Reduce

```js
const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = values.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

</Steps>
## Manipulating Arrays with Spread and Rest
The `spread (...)` and `rest (...rest)` operators are powerful tools for array manipulation. Spread is used for array expansion, while rest collects the remaining elements into a new array.

```js
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...originalArray, 4, 5];
console.log(newArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const [first, ...rest] = newArray;
console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(rest); // Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
```
## Working with Multi-Dimensional Arrays
Intermediate JavaScript often involves handling multi-dimensional arrays. Nested loops and array methods like flatMap can assist in manipulating such arrays.

```js
const matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];

const flattened = matrix.flatMap((row) => row.map((value) => value * 2));
console.log(flattened); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```

## Object-Oriented Array Manipulation

Understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript allows you to manipulate arrays using methods like sort and splice.

```js
const fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Orange'];

fruits.sort(); // In-place sorting
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']

const removedItem = fruits.splice(1, 1); // Removes one element at index 1
console.log(removedItem); // Output: ['Banana']
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['Apple', 'Orange']
```
## Benefits of Advanced Array Manipulation:
- Enhanced readability and maintainability of code.
- Efficient data transformation and filtering.
- Capability to work with complex data structures.

Mastering array manipulation at an intermediate level sets the stage for handling diverse datasets and solving more complex problems in your JavaScript projects.
