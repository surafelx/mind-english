# Function Types

## Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. They enable a functional programming style in JavaScript.

**Example**

```js
// Higher-order function taking a function as an argument
function operateOnArray(arr, operation) {
  return arr.map(operation);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const squaredNumbers = operateOnArray(numbers, (x) => x * x);
console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9]
```

## Callbacks

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to another function, which are then executed inside that function. They are commonly used in asynchronous operations and event handling.

**Example**

```js
function fetchData(url, callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { result: "some data" };
    callback(data);
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData("https://example.com/api/data", (result) => {
  console.log(result); // Output: { result: 'some data' }
});
```

## Partial Application and Currying

Partial application involves creating a new function by fixing some parameters of an existing function. Currying is a related concept where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

**Example**

```js
// Partial application
const add = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
const add5 = add.bind(null, 5); // Fixing the first parameter
console.log(add5(3, 2)); // Output: 10

// Currying
const curryAdd = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
console.log(curryAdd(5)(3)(2)); // Output: 10
```

Understanding these intermediate function concepts will enhance your ability to write more modular, flexible, and maintainable JavaScript code.
